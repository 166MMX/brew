{"name":"Linuxbrew","tagline":"The Homebrew package manager for Linux","body":"[Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) is a fork of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the Mac OS package manager, for Linux.\r\n\r\nFeatures, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](http://linuxbrew.sh).\r\n\r\nInstall Linuxbrew (tl;dr)\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nPaste at a Terminal prompt:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew/go/install)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Installation](#installation) below for more details.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n+ Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo\r\n+ Install software not packaged by the native distribution\r\n+ Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old\r\n+ Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* **Ruby** 1.8.6 or newer\r\n+ **GCC** 4.2 or newer\r\n+ **Linux** 2.6.16 or newer\r\n+ **64-bit x86** or **32-bit ARM** platform\r\n\r\nPaste at a Terminal prompt:\r\n\r\n### Debian or Ubuntu\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 python-setuptools ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fedora, CentOS or Red Hat\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' && sudo yum install curl git irb m4 python-setuptools ruby texinfo bzip2-devel curl-devel expat-devel ncurses-devel zlib-devel\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 32-bit x86 platforms\r\n\r\nLinuxbrew does not currently support 32-bit x86 platforms. It would be possible for Linuxbrew to work on 32-bit x86 platforms with some effort. Pull requests would be welcome if someone were to volunteer to maintain the 32-bit x86 support.\r\n\r\nBottles\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBottles are Linuxbrew's precompiled binary packages. Linuxbrew bottles work on any Linux system. They do however require `glibc` 2.19 or better. On systems with an older version of `glibc`, Linuxbrew will install `glibc` the first time that you install a bottled formula. If you prefer to use the `glibc` provided by your system and build all formulas from source, add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\r\n\r\n`export HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1`\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPaste at a Terminal prompt:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew/go/install)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you prefer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH\"\r\nexport MANPATH=\"$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH\"\r\nexport INFOPATH=\"$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're done!\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbrew install $WHATEVER_YOU_WANT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What Packages Are Available?\r\n1. Type `brew search` for a list.\r\n2. Or visit [braumeister.org](http://braumeister.org) to browse packages online.\r\n3. Or use `brew search --desc` to browse packages from the command line.\r\n\r\n## More Documentation\r\n`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme).\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nFirst, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.\r\n\r\nSecond, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).\r\n\r\n**If you don't read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**\r\n\r\n## Something broke!\r\n\r\nMany of the Homebrew formulae work on either Mac or Linux without changes, but some formulae will need to be adapted for Linux. If a formula doesn't work, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/linuxbrew/issues) or, even better, submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nPlease report security issues to security@brew.sh.\r\n\r\nThis is our PGP key which is valid until June 17, 2016.\r\n* Key ID: `0xE33A3D3CCE59E297`\r\n* Fingerprint: `C657 8F76 2E23 441E C879  EC5C E33A 3D3C CE59 E297`\r\n* Full key: https://keybase.io/homebrew/key.asc\r\n\r\n## Who Are You?\r\nLinuxbrew is maintained by [Shaun Jackman](http://sjackman.ca).\r\n\r\nHomebrew's current maintainers are [Misty De Meo](https://github.com/mistydemeo), [Andrew Janke](https://github.com/apjanke), [Xu Cheng](https://github.com/xu-cheng), [Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid), [Baptiste Fontaine](https://github.com/bfontaine), [Brett Koonce](https://github.com/asparagui), [Martin Afanasjew](https://github.com/UniqMartin), [Dominyk Tiller](https://github.com/DomT4), [Tim Smith](https://github.com/tdsmith) and [Alex Dunn](https://github.com/dunn).\r\n\r\nFormer maintainers with significant contributions include [Jack Nagel](https://github.com/jacknagel), [Adam Vandenberg](https://github.com/adamv) and Homebrew's creator: [Max Howell](https://github.com/mxcl).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCode is under the [BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\nDocumentation is under the [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\nHomebrew is a non-profit project run entirely by unpaid volunteers.
